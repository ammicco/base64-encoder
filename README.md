HERE'S AN IMPLEMENTATION OF A BASE64 ENCODER, TO UNDERSTAND HOW THE ENCODING ALGORITHM WORKS, HERE I DESCRIBE STEP BY STEP HOW TO MANUALLY ENCODE STRINGS FOR EXAMPLE IF YOU WANT TO CONVERT "ciao" INTO BASE64:
 - FIRST, YOU NEED TO SPLIT THE STRING LETTER BY LETTER:
    - c
    - i
    - a
    - o

 - NEXT YOU NEED TO CONVERT EACH LETTER TO BINARY, SO:
    - 01100011
    - 01101001
    - 01100001
    - 01101111

 - CONCATENATE ALL THE BINARY VALUES TOGETHER: 01100011011010010110000101101111

 - THEN, DIVIDE THE RESULTING STRING INTO GROUPS OF 6 BITS: 
    - 011000
    - 110110
    - 100101
    - 100001
    - 011011
    - 110000 <- HERE APPEND 4 ZEROS TO CREATE THE SIX-BIT STRING

 - NOW YOU HAVE TO CONVERT EACH GROUP FROM BINARY TO DECIMAL, SO:
    - 24
    - 54
    - 37
    - 33
    - 27
    - 48

 - THOSE INTEGER NUMBERS ARE CALLED BASE64 INDICES, EACH INDEX CORRESPONDS TO A LETTER. FOR THE COMPLETE LIST SEE "base64_enc.c". AFTER MATCHING INDEXES, CONVERT THEM TO LETTERS:
    - Y
    - 2
    - l
    - h
    - b
    - w

 - TO FINISH CONCATENATE ALL LETTERS TO GET THE BASE64 STRING "Y2lhbw"

THE PROGRAM WORKS WITH BIT SHIFT, BITWISE OR AND BITWISE AND.
